    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi! I'm a dedicated and curious student currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at MallaReddy Engineering College and Management Sciences. I have a strong interest in web development, programming, and exploring new technologies.

        I enjoy building small projects to sharpen my skills and bring my ideas to life. I'm always eager to learn more and improve through real-world experiences, internships, and collaboration.
        
        In my free time, I love solving coding challenges, reading tech blogs, and working on personal development. 

        I'm excited about the future and the opportunities it holds in the tech world and look forword to connecting with like minded individuals and proffessionals. I have recently completed my 'C'certificate in NCC holding 'B' certificate, actively participated in national camps and participated in various events and competetions
